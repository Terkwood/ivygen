	git push origin feature/my-feature

[pr]: https://github.com/mattiascibien/ivygen/compare/

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests
within three business days (and, typically, one business day). We may suggest
some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

 * Write a [good commit message][commit].
 * Write documentation both for developing and using. It will help the users to learn the program.
 * Always base your changes on the latest `develop` branch as the main repository follows the [GitFlow](http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/)
 branching model.
 * If your change is an added feature you can prefix your branch with `feature/` following the GitFlow convention.
